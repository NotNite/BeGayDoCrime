# BeGayDoCrime

Custom graffiti loader for BRC.

## Usage

- Install the plugin.
- Place your graffiti in `BepInEx/config/BeGayDoCrime`.
  - PNGs only. Must match the size of the original graffiti.
  - File name will be the name of the graffiti you want to replace (e.g. `Zona Leste.png`).
- Optional: Make a text file next to the image to set author information.
  - Line one is the artwork name, line two is the author name.
  - Same name as the PNG, just with a .txt extension.
